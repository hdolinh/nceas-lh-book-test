Special attention will be paid to qualitative data management, including practices working with sensitive data. Example datasets will draw from natural and social sciences, and methods for conducting reproducible research will be discussed in the context of both qualitative and quantitative data. Responsible and reproducible data management practices will be discussed as they apply to all aspects of the data life cycle. This includes ethical data collection and data sharing, data sovereignty, and the CARE principles. The CARE principles are guidelines that help ensure open data practices (like the FAIR principles) appropriately engage with Indigenous Peoplesâ€™ rights and interests.\n\n# Schedule\n\n# Code of Conduct\nPlease note that by participating in this activity you agree to abide by the NCEAS Code of Conduct.\n\n# Acknowledgements\nThese written materials reflect the continuous development of learning materials at the Arctic Data Center and NCEAS to support individuals to understand, adopt, and apply ethical open science practices.
