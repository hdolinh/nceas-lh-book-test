## Arctic Data Center Overview

The Arctic Data Center is the primary data and software repository for the Arctic section of National Science Foundation's Office of Polar Programs (NSF OPP).

We're best known in the research community as a data archive -- researchers upload their data to preserve it for the future and make it available for re-use. This isn't the end of that data's life, though. These data can then be downloaded for different analyses or synthesis projects. In addition to being a data discovery portal, we also offer top-notch tools, support services, and training opportunities. We also provide data rescue services.
